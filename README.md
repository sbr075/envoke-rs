# Features

- **Flexible Environment Variable Naming**  
  - Customize the case of environment variable names.  
  - Add global prefixes and suffixes (with per-field opt-out support).  

- **Multiple Ways to Define Environment Variables**  
  - Use the field name directly.  
  - Explicitly set the environment variable name to use.  
  - Define multiple environment variables as fallbacks. The order in which they are defined matters.  

- **Configurable Default Values**  
  - Support default values as field type defaults, static values, or function return values.  
  - Defaults can be used independently or as a fallback if no environment variable is found.  
  - Note that defaults are not run through validation or parsing functions.  

- **Custom Parsing Support**
  - Transform environment variable values before field assignment.  
    - Example: Convert a list of integers into a list of `Duration`.  

- **Value Validation**
  - Validate parsed values before assignment to ensure they meet expected constraints.  
    - Example: Ensure an integer is greater than `0`.  

- **Nested Struct Support**  
  - Populate multiple nested structs in a single call.  

- **Conditional Struct Loading**  
  - Dynamically load different structs based on an environment variable.  
  - Supports enums where each variant maps to a specific configuration struct.  
  - Enables flexible multi-environment configurations such as **Production**, **Staging**, and **Development**.  

- **Macro-Based Convenience**  
  - Works similarly to the `Default` traitâ€”define only the fields you need.  
  - Unspecified fields are auto-filled, but even explicitly defined fields need to be able to be loaded correctly.

# Usage
Add to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
envoke = "0.2.1"
```

## Example

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use anyhow::Context;
use envoke::{Envoke, Error, Fill};

#[derive(Debug, Fill)]
#[fill(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]
struct Prod {
    #[fill(env)]
    api_port: u16,
}

#[derive(Debug, Fill)]
#[fill(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]
struct Development {
    #[fill(env)]
    api_port: u16,
}

#[derive(Debug, Fill)]
#[fill(rename_all = "UPPERCASE")]
enum Mode {
    Production(Production),
    Development(Development),
}

fn above_thirty(secs: &u64) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    if *secs < 30 {
        anyhow::bail!("connect timeout cannot be less than 30 seconds, found {secs} second(s)")
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn to_duration(secs: u64) -> Duration {
  Duration::from_secs(secs)
}

#[derive(Debug, Fill)]
#[fill(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]
struct Environment {
    #[fill(nested)]
    mode: Mode,

    #[fill(env, default = Duration::from_secs(30))]
    #[fill(parse_fn = to_duration, arg_type = u64, validate_fn(before = above_thirty))]
    connect_timeout: Duration,
}

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let env =
        Environment::try_envoke().with_context(|| "An error occurred while loading environment");

    ...
}
```
